## Question 5- Select one of these distributions and in a paragraph, share your thoughts. (keep it simple 5 to 8 sentences).

**The distro that I chose is called dahliaOs.DahliaOs is a contemporary Os resulting from the merger of the GNU/Linux and Fuchsia, which is responsive and secure. There are three features that I found interesting about this Os. The first feature is internet recovery, which boots the latest image if something goes wrong with the system. The second feature is built-in containers, which allow users to run almost all apps within the Os. Finally, it is a very compact Os. It only uses 199 MB of RAM when idle. I try the demo, and I have to say that its simplicity makes it very intuitive to use. It reminds me a lot of chrome os.**
