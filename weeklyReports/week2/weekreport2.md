What is virtualization
- Simulation of a computer inside a  physical machine.
- There are 2 general types:
      - Server-side virtualization: process of creating multiple servers instaces from one physical server.
          * Virtual Desktop Infraestructure(VDI):
              + Thick client or fat client
              + Thin Client
              + Zero client
  
- Client-side virtualization: is a VM in the user's pc.
 + Characteristics:
   - Each pc has its own Os.
   - A hypervisor is needed to manage the VM.
- Type of hypervisor :
   * Type 1 runs on the hardware . It replaces the Os that you are using.ex,Vmware ESX/ESXI.
  
   * Type 2 runs on host Os installed in your pc. ex,Vmware workstation player/pro and Oracle virtualbox.
- Benefits of virtualization:
  - Allow you tested  before installing.
  - Reduces cost.
  - Increase the time labor.
