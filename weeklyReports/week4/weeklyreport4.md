## Summary of Presentation : navigating the filesystem

The summary must include the following:

A table of the commands in the presentation including what the command does and some examples

|Command          |definition                                                               |example                                                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|pwd              |displays the current working directory                                   |pwd                                                                      |
|cd               |used to change the current working directory                             | `cd  ~ /$HOME` (this will take you home).`cd -`(go to previous current working directory).`cd ../`(to go back the current working directory)|
|ls               |displays all file inside a given directory or current working directory  |`ls \Downloads`(show file in downloads).`ls -a `(show all files including hidden file).`ls -LR ~/Downloads`(long list all files recursively) .  |



**Important concepts**

1. File systems: it is a method use to organize and store data.Linux organizes its files in a hierarchical directory structure(tree-like pattern of folders).

2. Current directory: it is the directory where you are at the moment.

3. parent directory:it is the directory that containing the current directory.

4. the difference between your home directory and the home directory: 
   your home directory is the home directory of the user.For example,/home/username.On the other hand, the home directory is the home directory located in the root. For example, /home

5. pathname: it is an address that indicates the location of a file.

6. relative path: the location starts from the current working directory or a directory that is inside the current working directory.

7. absolute path:the location of a file starting from the root.

8. What is the right to repair movement and why does it matter?
Right to repair is a movement that looks for consumers to have more options to fix their product. As mentioned in the video, nowadays, there is a restriction for third parties to get schematic and even original part of a device obligating consumers to get it from the dealer or manufacturer. Furthermore, the fact that third parties can not get the schematic or part of the device says a lot. So, this means that there is monetarily interest involved with no doubt. As consumers, people must have the right to repair their stuff. The negligence towards our rights as consumers only benefits big companies, which become richer. On the other hand, as a student, having the right to repair will mean that I will have the necessary tools to fix my devices if I want to and learn in the process. On the other hand, I will have the freedom to pick the vendor that best suits my needs.
