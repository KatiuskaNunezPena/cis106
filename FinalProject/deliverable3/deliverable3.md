## Internet browsing
 Users of ubuntu can navigate the internet on the terminal by using a text-based browser. For this project , I will be using lynx.

- How to use linx:
Linx is an easy way to browse anything from the terminal .To lauch the website write the lynx + the website + enter key. because it is a text-based browser user must use the arrow key to move around.Besides, be aware that after you enter to a website ,on the bottom it will be a prompt waiting to be authorize to accept cookies .so you will have three different options like always,yes(y),or no(n). Noticed that at the bottom is the menu with helpful  options . such as how to exit the browser option or the help page.
